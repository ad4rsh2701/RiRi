/**
 * @brief ### WARNING: INTERNAL ZONE
 * 
 * If you are reading this, then you are in the internal zone of RiRi.
 * And you are 100% going to get an error or break something.
 * 
 * PLEASE DO NOT use internal maps defined here directly â€” they're NOT part of the public API.
 * 
 * - If you want to use `ankerl::unordered_dense::map`, please use it in your own code by including the appropriate headers (found [here](https://github.com/martinus/unordered_dense/blob/main/include/ankerl/unordered_dense.h)).
 * 
 * - If you really want to break something, go ahead or you can just use the public API, which is much safer and more stable.
 * 
 * - Or you can create a fork of RiRi (here: https://github.com/ad4rsh2701/riri) and modify it as you wish.
 * 
 * BACK OFF!

     * @brief ### Main Memory Map for Rapid Data Access

     * 
     * The map is initialized with a reserved size to optimize performance.
     * 
     * @note This map is used for storing rapid data types that can be strings, integers,

    // Yes, I leveled up and am using ankerl::unordered_dense::map with hash and equality
    // functions for std::string, as intended. This allows us for fast lookups using std::string_view keys.
    // Previously, I just used ankerl::unordered_dense::map<std::string, std::string>, which was definitely not optimal.

    // Levelled up AGAIN:
    // Now using ankerl::unordered_dense::map<std::string, RapidDataType> with a custom hash.
    // This allows us to store various types of data in the map, including strings, integers, doubles, and booleans.
    // Why a custom hash?
    // Because ankerl::unordered_dense::map does not support transparent hash "by default". You'd need to define a custom
    // struct to enable heterogeneous lookup. More details here: https://github.com/martinus/unordered_dense/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#324-heterogeneous-overloads-using-is_transparent

     * @brief ### Auxiliary Command Function Pointer Map

     * function pointers of type `RapidCommandFn`. 
     * 
     * - Used for auxiliary command handling.
     *

     * @note - The map is initialized to support a limited number of commands efficiently.
     * @note - The map is initialized with a small reserved size to optimize performance.
     * @note - The command functions should match the signature defined by `RapidCommandFn`.
     * @see RapidCommandFn for the function pointer type used for commands.
     * @see Commands.h for the list of available commands and their implementations.
